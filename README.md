# logic_gate
This is a program for generating logic gates to solve math problems like addition, substraction... basically everything a computer can do. There are absolutely no limit to what logic gate type you want to use and the number of operands, either.
The program was built for another purpose of testing the application of extensible streams and ended up pretty heavility on it.
